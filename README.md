# Vertebral Column Classification with KNN  

This project implements a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier to distinguish between **normal** and **abnormal** spine conditions using the [UCI Vertebral Column dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Vertebral+Column).  

The goal is to explore how distance metrics, training set size, and weighted voting affect the performance of non-parametric models.
